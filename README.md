### Summary: 
A game of blackjack against the dealer, which is an AI that plays by the house rules (hit if under 17). If you lose the hand, a joke appears. If you win, you will earn that amount of money and the country you play as will also gain that much on the leaderboard. 
You canâ€™t spend the country's money, only your own. Money is manually readded on the profile page when at 0.
